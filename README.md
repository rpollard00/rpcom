Hello, You found the repository for my personal site.

# Architecture

This site is designed to be run in a minimal environment. It's currently deploying to flyio using Docker and Github actions to build the site.

The frontend is built in React and the backend is built in Go. 
It has a login system, and blog engine. There is a backing Postgres database that stores both users and blog entries.
