          <p>
            My primary role has been as a Senior Network Engineer + Architect +
            I've been the primary architect and engineer in many areas, such as:
            Datacenter Networking (VXLAN BGP EVPN), SD-WAN Infrastructure,
            multi-homed BGP, public DNS. Plus, I've automated a lot of how we
            operate our network.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            There's more... I'm also a Cloud Engineer. I've architected and
            contributed to the architecture and design of a number of solutions
            on various MS Azure Platforms. Such as: Function Apps, Azure
            Container Instances, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, Azure VirtualWAN.
            All built with IaC and deployed with CI/CD pipelines.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I can also automate things with code that != IaC templates. I've
            built quite a bit of automation with Python.
